# OCA
OCA book for java certification.
These scripts implement what is discussed in the book OCA. Use this repo as study guide for you OCA exam or as a reference.

## Structure 
There are a total of six chapters in the book OCA Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer 1.

Every chapter will have scripts to solidify the concepts within JAVA, and a summary class that will try to implement the most important things of the chapter.
